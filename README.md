# Predicting Chronic Kidney Disease with Linear Regression
Chronic kidney disease is characterized by the kidney's inability to properly filter waste from the blood. The investigation of laboratory data and patient history can be used to determine what indicators would increase the chance of a patient developing the disease. The following dataset presents a binary classification problem.

My goal is to use a logistic regression model to show how well these factors can indicate a risk of the patient developing chronic kidney disease within a sample population. We will also examine what factor associated with abnormal findings in urinalysis and blood testing would most likely help indicate a risk of developing chronic kidney disease in the sample population.
